## Challenge #4
Awesome job! Other lighthouse operators are jealous of your grid. Just to show off, let's write a new function for the system which will count up how many cells total there are. Given the code you just wrote, this should be pretty easy.

Write a new function called totalCells() which will return the total number of cells in your grid. For this grid, it should return 100, but again make sure that is a calculated value and not just a number you type in for your function to return. We want to make all the other lighthouse operators jealous.
