## Challenge #13
Environment Canada has called and wants a report sent to them of all the rocks and currents in your grid, for use in their latest map.

Write a function called allRocks() which when called will return an array of the coordinates of all the rocks in your grid. (Example: allRocks() should return ['D1', 'E3', 'F3', 'E4', 'F4', 'B8', 'H8', 'B9', 'B10'])

Write a function called allCurrents() which, when called, will return an array of the coordinates of all the strong currents in your grid. (Example: allCurrents() should return ['E2', 'C8', 'D8', 'D9', 'E9', 'E10', 'F10'])
