Note: You can only complete ONE challenge a day - that way you will build up that daily habit, so no skipping ahead :)  

Welcome to the Lighthouse Labs 21-Day Coding Challenge! Over the next 21 days you will be responsible for managing the Lighthouse9000â„¢ and making sure it runs as smoothly as possible. As the Lighthouse operator, you will need to solve daily coding challenges to power the lighthouse and keep passing ships (and their passengers) safe.   

Click on the flashing radar below to start the first challenge. A new challenge will be unlocked everyday at midnight PST. Do all the challenges until the grid below is completely filled. Have fun!
