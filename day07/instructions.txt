## Challenge #7
In the area where the lighthouse is watching, the grid, there are many rocks which ships would need to avoid. Rocks are indicated with the ^ symbol on the grid.

Write a function called isRock() which will take in a coordinate in the form of 'C7' and return a true or a false boolean value depending on whether there is a rock in that cell or not. (Example: isRock('D1'); would return true)
